Intro
In the heart of the continent of Khorvaire lies Thrane, a theocratic nation dedicated to the worship of the Silver Flame. The Silver Flame Exorcists, a group of elite warriors and priests, are the embodiment of this divine fire, using its power to cleanse the world of supernatural threats and malevolent entities. With a rich history of archery and an unwavering faith, the Exorcists stand as a beacon of hope in a world filled with darkness.

Background Story
The Church of the Silver Flame has always been a stalwart force against the forces of darkness. From the shadows of the deep forests to the bustling streets of Flamekeep, evil entities and supernatural threats have always sought to disrupt the balance. The Silver Flame Exorcists, with their divine mandate, have stood strong against these challenges, combining their martial prowess with the purifying power of the Flame.

The Exorcists come from all walks of life â€“ from the common militia trained in the long-standing traditions of archery to the elite Silver Arrow Priestesses who channel the Flame's power through their blessed bows. Each Exorcist undergoes rigorous training, both physical and spiritual, ensuring that they can face any threat, be it a rampaging werewolf or a malevolent wraith.

As the world stands on the brink of chaos, with ancient evils awakening and new threats emerging, the Silver Flame Exorcists are more crucial than ever. Guided by their unwavering faith and armed with divine weapons, they are the last line of defense against the darkness that seeks to consume the world.
